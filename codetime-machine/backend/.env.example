GITHUB_TOKEN=       Create an interactive, visually engaging opening website with a "Dream Big" branding animation. The animation should have the following characteristics:

Requirements:

Overall Design:

The website should have a modern, clean, and dynamic look, aligning with the "cool" and fresh feel of "Supreme Dream Big" branding.

The branding should be prominent, reflecting a sense of ambition and positivity.

Animation Description:

Implement an animation that makes it appear as if "Dream Big" is being sprayed onto the screen in a graffiti-like style. This should flow across the entire webpage, with the words "Dream Big" progressively appearing and being sprayed from top to bottom.

The spray animation should start automatically if there is no interaction from the user for 5 seconds.

The animation should be smooth and dynamic, giving the effect of spray paint or an artistic flow across the screen.

It should cover the entire website, with the "Dream Big" text either fading in or moving down as if being written or sprayed.

Animation Trigger:

The animation should trigger after 5 seconds of inactivity (no user interaction like mouse movement, clicks, or scrolling).

Once the animation completes, the page should return to normal, with no disruptions to the user's ability to navigate the site.

Technologies:

Use HTML, CSS (for animations and layout), and JavaScript (for timing and detecting user inactivity).

Consider using animation libraries like GSAP or CSS keyframes for smooth and complex animations.

Additional Enhancements:

The animation should be visually appealing, engaging the user without being overwhelming. The overall site should balance modern design principles with playful, interactive elements.

Example Setup (Code Skeleton):
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Supreme Dream Big</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <div id="content">
    <!-- Website Content Goes Here -->
    <h1>Welcome to Supreme Dream Big</h1>
  </div>

  <div id="animation-container">
    <!-- Dream Big Animation -->
    <div class="dream-big">Dream Big</div>
  </div>

  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>


CSS (style.css):

body {
  font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
}

#content {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 2;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 50px;
}

#animation-container {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  z-index: 1;
  display: none;
}

.dream-big {
  font-size: 5rem;
  font-weight: bold;
  color: #fff;
  position: absolute;
  top: -100%;
  animation: sprayAnimation 5s forwards;
}

@keyframes sprayAnimation {
  to {
    top: 50%;
    opacity: 1;
  }
}


JavaScript (script.js):

let inactivityTimer;

function startInactivityTimer() {
  clearTimeout(inactivityTimer);
  inactivityTimer = setTimeout(startAnimation, 5000); // Trigger after 5 seconds of inactivity
}

function startAnimation() {
  const animationContainer = document.getElementById('animation-container');
  animationContainer.style.display = 'block';
}

function resetInactivityTimer() {
  startInactivityTimer();
}

document.body.addEventListener('mousemove', resetInactivityTimer);
document.body.addEventListener('keypress', resetInactivityTimer);
document.body.addEventListener('scroll', resetInactivityTimer);

startInactivityTimer(); // Initialize timer


This setup provides the basics for building the "Dream Big" animation and adds functionality to trigger it after a period of inactivity. You can further customize the animation style and branding elements to fit the "Supreme Dream Big" concept.
