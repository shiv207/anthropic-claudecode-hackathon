# Anthropic ClaudeCode Hackathon

Two distinct visions. One hackathon. We set out to explore the boundaries of AI—both as a tool for understanding our past, and as a voice for debating our future.

This repository serves as a monorepo submission for the Anthropic ClaudeCode Hackathon. Inside, you will find two independent projects that demonstrate the versatility of modern AI agents in varying domains: developer tooling and interactive entertainment.

## 1. Code Time Machine

**"Your repository's past, decoded."**

Understanding the history of a codebase often feels like archaeology. We wanted to change that. Code Time Machine is an AI-powered system that doesn't just list commits—it understands them.

By combining a FastAPI backend with a modern Next.js frontend, this tool analyzes your git history to provide semantic explanations of changes and detect performance regressions automatically. It allows developers to "travel back" through their project's timeline with an AI companion that can explain the *why* behind every change, and even suggest repairs for broken code.

**Key capabilities:**
*   Semantic commit analysis
*   Automated regression detection
*   AI-generated repair suggestions

## 2. The AI Philosopher

**"Silicon vs. Soul."**

What happens when we let AIs take the gloves off? The AI Philosopher is a real-time battle arena where different Large Language Models (LLMs) engage in a "Roast Battle" on the topic of Human Intuition vs. AI Utility.

Built with a retro-terminal aesthetic, this Next.js application forces two AI models to debate the merits of their own existence against the "irrationality" of human gut feelings. With a dedicated AI referee judging every burn, it serves as both a technical demo of model interaction and a philosophical playground.

**Key capabilities:**
*   Live AI-vs-AI debates
*   Dynamic "Roast" generation
*   Real-time judging system
